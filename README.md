# Summary

In this thesis a structured literature research was carried out to get an overview of the versatile topic "Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Robots". On the one hand, the focus is on the failure frequency and failure cause of the components of the industrial robot. On the other hand, it is to be conveyed which damages occur to the components and with which data sources these can be recorded, so that based on this a prognosis regarding the failure time of industrial robots can be made. To visualize the results, an interactive network graph was implemented in a web application.
